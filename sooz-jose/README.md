# Kilovolt Blog Lab 9

**Author**: Jose Flores and Suzanne Richman
**Version**: 1.0.1

## Overview
This product is designed to give users a consistent reading and navigation experience across mobile and desktop devices, with content ordered by most recent first and sortable by both author or category. Additionally, users who want to add articles to the blog with the submit button may now do so and the model database will be updated with their new article that they'll then be able to see on the home page with a page refresh. The articles are now stored and available via a database on a model instead of just from local storage. There is also now a full system architecture in place to support a more flexible and efficient application with a view (the two HTML pages), a controller (server.js) and a model (kilovold DB).

## Getting Started

The user would need to
* Create the index.html file.
* Get the icons from IcoMoon (including all related files and CSS).
* Get the normalize.css from github.com/necolas/normalize.css.
* Search and find images of bacon, baseball, and cats.
* Add filler text with all article properities for each one as an object literal into an array on a file called blogArticles.js (or eventually in to a database as rows in a table).
* Build CSS files according to SMACSS methodology.
* Include link to jQuery library (CDN).
* Create the articles as objects within an array with consistent property values.
* Create a constructor function to make the article array accessible to the constructor's method.
* Use jQuery to access and clone HTML elements of the DOM and populate those elements with content from the article array.
* Create forEach loops to generate new object instances and then append them to the DOM.
* Create an array of objects to hold the content generation for the DOM for each object.
* Create a JS file to generate a more interactive view of the DOM (selecting authors, catagories and hiding/showing full articles as well as navigating the long page as if it was a multipage website).
* Add Handlebars library and use it to create a tempalte for the HTML articles.
* Add the Higlight JS library and related CSS styling to have the ability to highlight content.
* Create a new HTML page to handle article submissions that offers a form to create an article and ability to preview content.
* Connect the new HTML page to the exisiting blog page and update articleView.js, as well as articles.js to render content correctly across both pages.
* Be sure to write DRY code and leverage the libraries used.
* Regularly use console logs, Chrome developer console tools and the help of others to identify and correct all coding and rendering erros.
* Convert the blogArticle.js to JSON file, hackerIpsum.json.
* Next the user will need to install several npm packages including Express and nodemon, fs, bodyparser, pg. 
* The user needs to be sure to create a proper .gitignore file.
* Change all functions to arrow functions where possible and contextual this is not used.
* Install postgreSQL to your system.
* Create a kilovolt database to store your articles and authors tables. 
* Write SQL queries to connect the database to the controller for use by the view.
* Write jQuery and JS to leverage the new Node and JS packages and libraries to make sure all created content in the database (model), is accessible by the controller (server.js) and that the view (the HTML files) may make requests of the data and recieve the data in a way that is easy to consume for any end user. 

## Architecture

We used IcoMoon icon font for navigation icons. We included the jQuery, Handlebars, Hightlight JS, and Railcasts libraies, with related CSS as needed. We installed and used Express, pg, fs and nodemon npm JS packages. We installed and used postgreSQL. We worked to create a RESTful website application. We used Chrome, and nodemon to analyze and inspect the view and the controller. We used the postgreSQL shell to check model. Project is built used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node and SQL. We used CRUD testing to ensure the entire system architecture is working as expected for both our developer and end users.
