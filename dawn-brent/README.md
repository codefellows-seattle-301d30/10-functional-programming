## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This is a blog that includes a large number of articles from a few authors.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Have postgres ready to function, have an articles db in postgres, set conString in server.js as is appropriate for your own machine.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
This uses HTML, CSS, javascript, jQuery, Handlebars, Postgres, and icomoon. The basic structure is to create a database on your local machine full of articles. The webpage then reads from that database and manipulates the articles as appropriate via a server. This works to locally simulate a typical web mvc pattern.


## Change Log
<!-- Use this are to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with GET and POST routes for the book resource.-->
2018-02-28 8:20pm server interacts with webpage properly.

## Credits and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->
Brent and Dawn collaborated on this project. We began with a codebase provided by Code Fellows and a number of feature tasks (all available within the same file tree as this file).
