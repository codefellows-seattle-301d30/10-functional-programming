As a user, I want additional stats so that I can track the progress of my app.

## Getting Started
Get the starter-code from Allie.  Load all the node modules. 

## Architecture
All the data is stored on the postgreSQL database and the node.js is the server.  The data is transfered from the database and sent thru a consgtructor to make an Article, then saved into an aray.  The data is sorted and the words are counted and ay]uthors compiled for display i]onthe admin page.  A new article page wil;l send i]the new article data to the Article consgructor to add a new article.
